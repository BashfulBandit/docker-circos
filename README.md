# docker-circos

This is the Git repo of a Docker image for [circos](http://circos.ca/). 

## What is circos?

Circos is a software package for visualizing data and information. It visualizes data in a circular layout â€” this makes Circos ideal for exploring relationships between objects or positions. There are other reasons why a circular layout is advantageous, not the least being the fact that it is attractive.

Circos is ideal for creating publication-quality infographics and illustrations with a high data-to-ink ratio, richly layered data and pleasant symmetries. You have fine control each element in the figure to tailor its focus points and detail to your audience.
